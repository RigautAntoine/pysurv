    Implements parametric Exponential model for univariate data:
    S(t) = exp(-(lambda*t)),   lambda >0
    H(t) = lambda*t
    h(t) = lambda

    The probability of failure is the same in every time interval, i.e. hazard rate is constant.
    The constant hazard function is a consequence of the memoryless property of the exponential
    distribution: the distribution of the subjectâ€™s remaining survival time given that s/he has
    survived till time t does not depend on t.
